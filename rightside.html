      However, one day, a disaster suddenly struck this supposedly quiet 
      and peaceful town. As night fell, the townspeople were enveloped 
      by an ominous aura; some began to move slowly and behave strangely,
       and what was even more disturbing was their eyes, which became hollow 
       and terrifying. Initially, people did not take it seriously, thinking 
       it was just a momentary prank or misunderstanding. But as time went on, 
       strange sounds and lights began to appear in the sky every night, 
       making the people of the village feel more and more frightened. 
       Occasionally, residents would also disappear inexplicably, 
       causing people to panic even more.
