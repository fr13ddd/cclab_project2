      As these unexplained phenomena increased, the town gradually became desolate and fearful.
       People fled in all directions, looking for shelter. And in the midst of this panic, 
       the little old church became the last refuge.<br>
        When the townspeople gathered in the church, they found that it had already been prepared. 
        The church was filled with simple beds and some simple food and water. Over the next few days, 
        the church's walls were strong and people continued to feel relatively safe, even though the strange
        phenomena continued each night. However, as time passed, the people began to realize that survival 
       in this town had become impossible. They realized that they had to leave the town, find a new refuge, 
        and start their lives anew.
